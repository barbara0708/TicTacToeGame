## Introduction
    My simple TicTacToe Game was created for two players. One player plays X and the other O. 
    You can take turns by clicking on a grid three-by-three cell. If a given player gets three marks in a row horizontally, 
    vertically, or diagonally, then that player wins the game. You can check your score above the board.
